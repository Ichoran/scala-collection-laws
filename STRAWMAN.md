# Strawman Collections

This branch is meant to run the Strawman Collections alongside the standard
collections.  This is only intended to be temporary until the new
collections are perfected and integrated.

For now, jars for the strawman collections and sourcecode, compiled for
2.13.0-M2, should be placed in the `lib` directories in `laws` and `tests`.
